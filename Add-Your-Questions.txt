Q.) Vijay is given a problem to solve. he is given an array of names and asked to find duplicates in the names. Vijay builds a hashtable with all the names and uses that to find duplicates. Which of the following statements are true?

(unless otherwise stated, assume that the hash-function and hash-table are working well and doing a good job.) pick all that apply in most cases,)

1) the program will run in o(n) time in most cases,
2) the program will run in o(n log n) time in most cases,
3) the program will run in o(n^2) time
4) if the hash-function is a doing a bad job, and there are lots of collisions, the program will run in o(n log n) time
5) if the hash-function is a doing a bad job, and there are lots of collisions, the program will run in o(n^2)times
