1. Create the following pattern using any language of your choice. (Notice the slight change in middle element!)
        1
       121
      12321
     1235321
      12321
       121
        1
        
2. Swap any two numbers without using the temporary variable. (No restriction on language)

3.Given an array A with N elements arranged in an ascending order, also given a number K.
Check if their exist two indices such that sum of elements at those indices is equal to K. If Yes print those indices accordingly else print no answer.
NOTE: If there are multiple such pair (i, j), print max j value pair and if all j′s are equal print min i value pair.
