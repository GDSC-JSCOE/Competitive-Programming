 Example : 
 Solution :
# Python  
age=input(int("Age : "))
print(age);
                                                                                                                                               Maintainer : Gaurav-2803
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets (Hi!, Hey!, Hello!, etc) them with their name. 
Example : (Hi!, Gaurav)
Solution : 
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main(){
    string name;
         cout<<" Enter Name : ";
         cin>>name;
         cout<<"Hi "+name;
 return 0;
}
2. Modify the previous program (i.e. Q.1) such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
Solution : 
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main(){
    string name;
         cout<<" Enter Name : ";
         cin>>name;
         if(name=="Alice" || name=="ob")
         {
          cout<<"Hi "+name;
         }else{
          cout<<"Hi";
         }
        return 0;
}
3. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
Solution : 
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n, a;
    a = 0;
    cin >> n;
    n++;
    while (n--)
    {
        a = a + n;
    }
    cout << a;
    return 0;
}

  

4. Modify the previous program (i.e. Q.3) such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
Solution : 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n, a;
    a = 0;
    cin >> n;
    n++;
    while (n--)
    {
        if (n % 3 == 0 || n % 5 == 0)
        {
            a = a + n;
        }
    }
    cout << a;
    return 0;
}

5. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.
Solution : 

6. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
Solution : 
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
    {
        a = 12 * i;
        cout << a << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
7. Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 2 numbers. 
Solution : 

8. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.
Solution : 

9. Write a function that returns the largest element in a array.
Solution : 

10. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a array.
Solution : 

11. Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.
Solution : 

12. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a array: using a for-loop, a while-loop and recursion.
Solution : 

13. Write a function that concatenates two arrays. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]
Solution : 

14. Write a function that merges two sorted into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]. You can do this quicker than concatenating them followed by a sort.
Solution : 

15. Write a function that computes the list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8.
Solution : 

16. Write a function that return the Factorial of given number n.
Solution : 

17. Print the following pattern without using print in-built function.
i.      ii.     iii.
***     123     321
***     123     321
***     123     321
Solution : 

18. Convert i. Minutes -> Seconds 
            ii. Fahrenheit -> Celsius -> Kelvin
Solution : 

19. Design a quiz game which take answer as input to given question (atleast 5) and print final result(Total marks & percentage). +2 for Correct answer, -0.5 for Incorrect.
Solution : 

20. Design a tool which find area & perimeter of different shapes.
Solution : 

21. Return first, middle & last element of array.
Solution :
